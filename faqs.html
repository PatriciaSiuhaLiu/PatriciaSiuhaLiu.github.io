                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>The Federal Council decided at the onset of the pandemic in early 2020 that all non-essential travel had to be stopped to reduce the spread of the virus. Suspending the issuing of
                        visas helped to achieve this goal. With the gradual lifting of restrictions on entry in line with the EU recommendations on individual third countries, Switzerland
                         is also starting to issue visas again.</p>
